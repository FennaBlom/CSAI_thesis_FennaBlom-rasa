# CSAI_thesis_FennaBlom-rasa

This repository contains the code for my master thesis. This code covers the implementation of the conversational agent. 

The repository does not include the SciBERT model as it was too big to upload. This model, however, is available upon request.

The code for the classification and explainability can be found here: https://github.dev/FennaBlom/CSAI_thesis_FennaBlom-classification-explanation
